First project, woo!

Only works with nexstar SE series!!!
Inside main/ there should be a python script called Sat Track.py, 
to use the script, align the telescope (or point directly north) and
plug the hand control into the telescope. 
Then you'll need to change the com port that you have connected with and if
needed, change the tle data.

Then just run it with python 3.7.*.
